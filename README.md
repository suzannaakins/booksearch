# Booksearch

## Description
I tried to refactor a fully functioning booksearch website that used an API to find and save books to a user's account.  
I rewrote it using Apollo to write typeDefs, resolvers, queries, and mutations.  I got a lot of it working like this.  I'm still having issues with the saveBook function.  It's saying "invalid token".  If anyone has ideas how to fix this, please connect with me on LinkedIn.  Thank you!
